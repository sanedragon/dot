# Explanation #

In this directory are various settings files for things that generally apply in
a Linux/Unix/OS X environment. Included is a Rakefile that replaces local settings
files with symlinks to the files here in an intelligent, interactive way.

## Deploy ##

Clone this git repo and then use 'rake' to install the settings.
